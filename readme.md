# Code Samples

## HTML & CSS (design and build websites)

Computer books often look rather like manuals. They can be dense and intimidating (they may even send you to sleep), but this book proves that they do not need to look like that.

Each page of this book introduces a new topic in a simple, visual way with straightforward explanations accompanied by bite-sized code samples. At the end of each chapter there is an in-depth example that puts together the techniques it has covered. No previous experience is necessary.

One of the key things that makes this book different from other titles that teach the same subject is its completely new design approach. The full-color pages are packed with diagrams and photos that make the code easier to learn.

- HTML and CSS are color-coded which make the examples easier to follow
- Each topic starts on a new page, so the book remains a helpful reference you can flick through after you have read it
- You are shown how to build interesting examples, all of which have been beautifully photographed
- Complex topics are simplified with the use of large infographics

Alongside the code, there is plenty of practical advice on topics such as how to resize and prepare images for the web, how to control typography, and search engine optimization (SEO), so that you will be equipped with the full range of skills needed to create great looking websites.
