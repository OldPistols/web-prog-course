# HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a markup language used for creating web pages and other types of content that can be displayed in a web browser. HTML consists of a series of tags that are used to mark up the content of a web page, such as text, images, videos, and links. These tags allow web developers to structure and format web content, and to create hyperlinks between different pages and websites. HTML is one of the core technologies used to create the World Wide Web, and it is constantly evolving to meet the changing needs of web developers and users.

## HTML Structure
HTML structure refers to the way in which an HTML document is organized and formatted. An HTML document has a basic structure that consists of the following elements:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: 
This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used.

2. `<html>`: This tag indicates the start and end of an HTML document. All other tags should be nested inside this tag.

3. `<head>`: This tag contains metadata about the HTML document, such as the title, stylesheets, and scripts. This tag is not visible to the user.

4. `<body>`: This tag contains the visible content of the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
Here is an example of the basic structure of an HTML document:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="description" content="This is my web page.">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
    <a href="https://example.com">Click here to go to Example.com</a>
  </body>
</html>
```
  
In this example, the document type is declared as HTML5 using `<!DOCTYPE html>`. The content of the web page is enclosed between the <html> tags. The <head> tag contains metadata, such as the title of the page, a description, a stylesheet, and a script. The `<body>` tag contains the visible content of the web page, such as a heading, a paragraph, an image, and a link.

Note that the structure of an HTML document can be more complex than this example, depending on the needs of the web page. However, this basic structure provides a starting point for creating an HTML document.

## Useful HTML tags

### 1. `<html>`
This tag indicates the start and end of an HTML document. All other tags should be nested inside this tag.

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

### 2. `<head>`
This tag contains metadata about the HTML document, such as the title, stylesheets, and scripts. This tag is not visible to the user.

```php
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
```
  
### 3. `<body>`
This tag contains the visible content of the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

```php
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
  <a href="https://example.com">Click here to go to Example.com</a>
</body>
```
  
### 4. `<h1>` to `<h6>`
These tags are used to create headings of different levels. The `<h1>` tag is the most important heading, and the `<h6>` tag is the least important.
  
```php
<h1>This is a Level 1 Heading</h1>
<h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
<h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
<h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>
<h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>
<h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6>
```
  
### 5. `<p>`
This tag is used to create paragraphs of text.

```php
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph of text.</p>
```

### 6. `<a>`
This tag is used to create links to other web pages or to specific locations on the same page.

```php
<a href="https://example.com">Click here to go to Example.com</a>
<a href="#section2">Click here to go to Section 2</a>
```
  
### 7. `<img>`
This tag is used to insert images into the web page.

```php
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
```
  
### 8. `<ul>` and `<li>`: 
These tags are used to create unordered lists, where each item in the list is marked with a bullet point.
Example:

```php
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
  
### 9. `<ol>` and `<li>`
These tags are used to create ordered lists, where each item in the list is numbered.
Example:

```php
<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```
  
### 10. `<div>` and `<span>`
These tags are used to group elements together and apply styles or scripting to the group.

```php
<div class="container">
  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</div>
<span class="highlight">This text is highlighted.</span>
```
These are just some of the useful HTML tags along with examples. There are many more
