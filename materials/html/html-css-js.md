# HTML, CSS and JS

## Overview
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three primary technologies used for building modern web applications. Here's a brief overview of each:

### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML is a markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It defines the various elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML is the foundation of every web page and provides the basic structure of a web page.

HTML uses markup tags to create the structure and content of web pages. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets `<>` and can have attributes that provide additional information about the tag. For example, the `<h1>` tag is used to create a heading, and it can have an attribute like class or id that allows you to apply styling or scripting to the element.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of web pages, including layout, fonts, colors, and other visual effects. It allows web developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to maintain and update. CSS enables web developers to create visually appealing and responsive web pages.

CSS uses selectors and declarations to style and format web pages. A selector is used to identify the HTML element to be styled, while a declaration is used to set the style properties. For example, the selector `.my-class` targets all HTML elements with the class `my-class`, and the declaration "`color: red;`" sets the color of the text to red.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a scripting language used for creating interactive web applications. It runs in the browser and allows developers to add dynamic and interactive elements to a web page, such as animations, form validation, and user interface components. JavaScript is used to enhance the user experience of web applications and provide greater interactivity.

JavaScript: JavaScript uses statements and expressions to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Statements are used to perform actions or control the flow of the code, while expressions are used to create values or perform calculations. For example, the statement `if (x > 5) { alert('x is greater than 5'); }` checks if the variable `x` is greater than 5 and displays an alert message if it is.

In summary, HTML provides the structure and content of web pages, CSS provides the visual presentation of web pages, and JavaScript provides the interactivity and dynamic behavior of web pages. Together, these technologies enable web developers to create modern, responsive, and interactive web applications.
